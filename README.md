This project's objective is to project a company's revenue by querying Salesforce for Closed Won opportunities, summing up all amounts, and then obtaining the revenue per quarter. Then, a simple Python program using Matplotlib graphs the revenue by quarters since the 0th quarter of the company. Then, given a new x, interpreted as the next quarter, the program predicts the revenue of that quarter and plots the new point using linear regression. The project also includes web frontend that enhances the user experience by displaying that quarter's revenue when the user hovers over a data point.
